# HeartDiseasePredictor_webapp
This is a web application for predicting the risk of heart disease based on various input features.

## Description

This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of a patient having heart disease. It provides a user-friendly interface for users to input their information and receive a prediction.

## Features

- Collects user data such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, etc.
- Applies a trained machine learning model to predict the risk of heart disease.
- Displays the prediction result along with relevant information.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Flask
- HTML/CSS
- JavaScript
- Machine learning (scikit-learn, etc.)
  
#Application consists of :
-static: consist of animated videos of heart to improve the user's experience
-templates: it consists of html templates for the provision of web service
-app.py: flask application to run the whole project
-model.pkl: stores the pickled file of the heart disease prediction model
-requirement.txt: this file enlabels the required libraries to be installed for the project

## Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required dependencies from taking reference from requirement.txt file
3. Run the flask application(named: app.py)
4. Open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to access the application.
5. Input the required information and click "Predict the risk" to receive the prediction result.
